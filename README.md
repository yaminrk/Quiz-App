This is a interactive quiz application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application presents a series of questions of different types to the user, collects their answers, and displays the results at the end.

#The JavaScript code is structured into several functions, each responsible for a specific part of the quiz:

#The code has comments explaining it in through detail

#My main focus on this project was to create a readable and clean code.
